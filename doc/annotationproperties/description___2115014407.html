It may be a precondition or effect of some Activity, or more generally it may enabled or be caused by some Activity. If a state is complex, it may refer to some combination of classes of manifestations.<br />A note on complex states:<br />Say that a shopping activity, Activity-Shop, requires both the VehicleW30LGas state, but also some state wherein the mall is open, OpenMall. Each state would first be defined separately. Then, we can simply state:<br />precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) AND  precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)<br />were the preconditions required disjunctively, we could state:<br />precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) OR precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)<br />However, in large and complex domains, there will be cases in which the above approach is undesirable. In particular, due to the complexity of the description that results as the state being described becomes more detailed. In many cases it will be more natural and convenient to be able to refer to a single, aggregate state. We therefore extend the representation of States to capture aggregation, as approached in the concept of state trees introduced by TOVE as a construct for the activity cluster.<br /><br />A State may be either non-terminal or terminal. A terminal state has no child states, and therefore refers directly to a class of manifestations, whereas a non-terminal state has child states, which may define some classes of manifestations, or further define some other complex states.<br />	NonTerminalState(x) v TerminalState(x) = State(x)<br />A state  cannot be both non-terminal and terminal.<br />	TerminalState disjointWith NonTerminalState"</span>&nbsp;</li>

<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"	<br />		Given that all of the projects within iCity are situated in the urban domain, and therefore it is not surprising to find many common concepts between them. It stands to reason that some integration between the different applications should be possible. For example, if data is collected about the population, it should be usable by ILUTE and other simulations, but also by the projects developing analysis tools, such as the smart parking application. Unfortunately, there is also ambiguity in how different concepts are used, and in some cases the same concept may be defined differently in different applications. This provides a challenge not only for integration of the iCity applications, but for shareability of results: if the knowledge generated by iCity is not defined sufficiently, it will be difficult for any other researchers to understand and leverage it. <br />The iCity ontology provides a common set of terms with which data can be stored and accessed. The ontology will resolve any ambiguities and disagreements between terms by defining a common set of concepts that completely captures the domain, with agreed-upon definitions. In the case that two applications attribute a different meaning to the same term, the result will be two distinct terms with distinct, precisely defined meanings. In this way we can recognize these differences and clearly identify the relationships between different concepts. The ontology will be used to organize and describe data within the iCity project. It may also be used as means of publishing or sharing data with the research community.<br />The resulting artifact, often referred to as the knowledge base will take the form of a triple-store(s) , created by mapping data from the iCity applications to the agreed-upon terminology defined in the iCity ontology.  Beyond this, the precise and formal nature of the ontology will support the use of services such as inference and data validation. Based on the definitions, we may be able to infer new information that was not originally part of the knowledge base. Data validation is supported as a result of the consistency-checking mechanism. We also hope that identification of relationships may serve to uncover synergies between the projects, by illustrating how data from one project may serve to inform the work of another. <br /><br /><br />In the urban system, we recognize the following key concepts that must be defined:<br />Person, Organization, Household, Building, Parking, Vehicle, Transportation Networks, Transit, Land Use, Travel.<br />The semantics of each of these concepts will be defined by a generic ontology. These generic ontologies will then be used in the iCity ontology to define the urban system and its behaviour; its population, land use, transportation infrastructure, and the travel that occurs within it. This representation may then be extended to capture the individual iCity applications so that they may be integrated with one another and sufficiently well-defined so as to be shareable and reproducible with the research community. A Foundational Ontology will be also required in order to define the core concepts that apply across the transportation domain."</span></li>

<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"In addition to the concepts that are specific to an urban system, there exist foundational concepts that are required to fully define the domain.

<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"Many of the concepts identified in the urban system ontologies are subject to change. For example, a Vehicle will have one location at one time, and another location at a later time; it may have only one passenger at one time, and four passengers at a later time. Similarly, many attributes of Persons, Households, and even Transportation Networks are subject to change. An approach to representing changing properties, or fluents, that leverages the 4-dimensionalist perspective was proposed by (Welty, Fikes, and Makarios, 2006). We adopt a similar approach, based on a re-interpretation by Krieger (2008) requiring the division of classes that are subject to change into two parts: invariant and variant parts of the concept; we refer to these as TimeVaryingConcept and Manifestation classes, respectively. By distinguishing between these class types and recognizing the properties that are (and aren't) subject to change, the ontology supports the capture of both the static and dynamic aspects of a particular entity.

<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"This ontology provides a generic representation of resources that contain core properties generic across all transportation uses. We take the view presented in the TOVE model (Fadel, Fox, and Gruninger, 1994) that "...being a resource is not an innate property of an object but a property that is derived from the role the object plays with respect to an activity". The definition of  a resource is dependent on its participation in an activity occurrence, so the Resource ontology is in fact an extension of the Activity ontology. In this sense, Resources are a class of manifestations, so that rather than have a specialized Resource-perdurant (PD) class, a Resource is a manifestation of some other perdurant class in the ontology. For example, an instance of a Vehicle that is a manifestation of some VehiclePD may also be an instance of a resource, whereas some other instance of a Vehicle that is some later manifestation of the same VehiclePD may not be a Resource, or it may be a different Resource. <br />		"</span></li>
<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"To capture generic spatial features we require concepts of location, but also concepts of geometry in order to describe shapes that are more complex than a single point in space.

<li class="asserted"><span class='Annotation Property active-entity'>Description</span> <span class='literal'>"While most existing work attempts to describe the network based on its physical constructs, we model the network flow and the physical infrastructure separately. The motivation for this is that the constraints on transportation flow are something that is applied to the physical infrastructure. These constraints are distinct from the physical characteristics  and so should be defined separately. Although some constraints may be related, such as flow constraints imposed by the size of the lane that an arc accesses, this is a specific relationship that should be captured rather than conflating the concepts. For example, there is nothing to stop a vehicle from going the wrong way on a road, except for the flow of traffic that is imposed on the system (and these constraints may change with time). This results in the identification of two key concepts: the Transportation Network (a directed graph), and the Transportation Infrastructure (a physical feature where transportation occurs).<br /><br />We relate the Network and the Infrastructure by relating an Arc to a Transportation Complex (or other Road Segment) with the "accesses" property. In this way, we may define an Arc accessing various Transportation Complexes at different Levels of Detail (LOD).<br />In this representation Nodes do not access the Transportation Infrastructure nor are they part of it in any way. Both Nodes and Arcs may have implicit locations based on the infrastructure they access, however unlike the infrastructure classes, Nodes and Arcs are not Spatial Things. A Node may have a control (e.g. a signal) with a physical presence somewhere else (traffic lights apply to one side of the intersection, but are actually located on the other side of the intersection); by separating the physical infrastructure and the network flow we are able to accurately represent this.<br /><br />Currently, there is no need to capture an aggregate Arc; in other words, we do not require a subArc relation. It is possible this may change as the requirements evolve.<br />"</span></li>
