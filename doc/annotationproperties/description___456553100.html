An enabling state defines what has to be true of the world in order for the activity to be performed. A caused state defines what is true of the world once the activity has been completed.<br /><br />An activity, along with its enabling and caused states, is called an activity cluster.The state tree linked by an enables relation to an activity specifies what has to be true in order for the activity to be performed. The state tree linked to an activity by a causes relation defines what is true of the world once the activity has been completed.

Communication-links capture the notion of benevolent communication in which agents regard each other as peers volunteer information that they believe relevant to other agents. This exchange does not create obligations for any agent.<br /><br />The communication-link is a unidirectional link used to communicate information from one agent to another. It describes, for an agent in a given organizational role, the information it is interested in receiving and the information it can benevolently distribute to others.<br /><br />For example, an agent in the “C++ programmer” role may distribute information about the state of the file server to other programmers, alerting them each time the server is down."</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

For OA1 to have authority over OA2 implies that OA1 is able to extract a commitment from OA2 to achieve a goal that is defined as part of OA2’s organization-roles. In order to extract that commitment, OA1 has to be related directly or indirectly by a communication-with-authority (CWA) link relation.<br /><br />The Communication-with-Authority link, used when communication is intended to create obligations, specifies the two agents, one in the authority position (called supervisor) and the other in the controled position (called supervisee), among which communication takes place. Because we model communication as exchange of speech-acts, authority of an agent appears as the set of speech-acts this agent can use in order to create obligations for the other agent. For example, an agent may have authority to request another agent to perform action A1, but not to perform action A2. In this case, the second agent will have to commit to achieving A1 when requested by the first agent, but not A2."</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>
