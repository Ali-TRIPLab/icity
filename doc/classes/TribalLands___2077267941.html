It may also serve as a guide to developing appropriate<br />categories for complex ownership constraints in LBCS for countries outside<br />the U.S.<br />Ownership constraint plays a vital role in most tribal planning efforts, which<br />includes geographies beyond those lands that are commonly known as<br />Indian Reservations. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a special federal designation for<br />certain federal lands, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indian ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ along with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Military<br />ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are probably the most well known in the planning profession.<br />Areas (including pueblos, rancherias, communities, etc.) designated as Indian<br />Reservations, mainly through long-standing treaties and current established<br />federal government processes (such as congressional acts, executive orders,<br />and administrative acts), are only a subset of tribal lands. Some states also<br />recognize other tribes and groups that do not currently have the federal<br />designation. Moreover, some tribes are seeking federal recognition,<br />therefore, it is possible that what constitutes tribal lands will not remain<br />constant.<br />More than 550 tribes, which include 223 village groups in Alaska, are<br />federally recognized. About 350 tribes have land holdings in roughly 275<br />Indian land areas covering over 56 million acres. These lands are held in<br />trust by the federal government (the Secretary of the Interior serves as the<br />trustee) for the various tribes, and in some cases for individuals. Hence the<br />term Ã¢â‚¬Å“trust land,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is sometimes mistaken for reservation land though<br />not all reservation land is trust land. In short, reservation lands are a subset<br />of trust lands, which in turn are a subset of tribal lands.<br />A single reservation may extend across one or more state boundaries, such as<br />the 16 million-acre Navajo Reservation, which spreads across three states:<br />Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. Any power the states have over the<br />reservations is limited to what the federal law has granted. Each reservation<br />has a local governing authority, commonly referred to as the tribal<br />government. Land-use planning operates in much the same way as in other<br />local governments with some significant differences when it comes to<br />ownership constraints. It is these differences that form the subcategories of<br />this major category.<br />1). Tribal land in federal trust (primarily reservations)<br />2). Tribal fee land (private corporate ownership)<br />3). Individual tribal member allotted land in federal trust<br />Tribal land in federal trust is constrained by federal regulations much in the<br />same way as other lands although the process for federal approvals is not<br />similar. Tribal fee land is subject to the same zoning and subdivision<br />regulations of the local government where the land is located. Although<br />many reservations are entirely tribally owned, it is not uncommon for nontribal<br />members to own and occupy tribal lands. Allotted land refers to the<br />federal trust lands that have been parceled out to individual tribal members<br />in 160-acre units as part of a 1920s and 1930s federal policy. Land-use plans<br />extend over all three types of ownership constraints.<br />Another aspect that requires clarification when classifying ownership<br />constraints relates to tribal and state compacts. Depending on their purposes,<br />compacts may affect ownership constraints. For example, following the 1988<br />Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which allows traditional Indian gaming as<br />well as bingo, pull tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, and certain card games<br />on tribal land, many tribes used compacts for other forms of gaming, such as<br />cards or slot machines. Hence the growth in number of casinos and gamingtype<br />developments on Indian lands. Twenty-four states and 130 tribes use<br />such compacts to regulate gaming and gambling uses. To classifying such<br />multi-tiered ownership in LBCS, assign multiple ownership codes, where<br />each code refers to one or more forms of tribal ownership along with the<br />appropriate state government category."</span>(<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" class='Datatype' title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">xsd:string</a>)</li>
