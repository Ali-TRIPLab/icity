These halls have<br />high ceilings (25 to 35 feet) and can accommodate a variety of events. Some<br />very large cities (Chicago, for example) have multilevel exhibition halls.<br />Convention structures have both an exhibition hall and a number of meeting<br />rooms. Many also have kitchen and banquet facilities, and an auditorium for<br />special events. Trade shows, public shows, conventions, food functions,<br />receptions, dances, banquets, assemblies, and other activities are typically<br />hosted in these structures.<br />Multipurpose structures have combinations of exhibition, convention, and<br />arena facilities. Some of these may be co-located or created out of a single<br />enclosed space that is reconfigured.<br />This category also includes the horseshoe-shaped auditorium buildings<br />popular in the 1930s and 1940s in many midsize to big cities. These<br />structures have a fixed stage at one end of a flat floor area on which were<br />portable seats on risers and fixed seats on other levels. Multipurpose arenas<br />have since replaced these kinds of structures.<br />Trade centers are not included here. They are usually a special-purpose office<br />building for a specific group of enterprises (brokers, importers, freight<br />forwarders, etc.). These structures belong in the office building category.<br />Merchandise marts also serve the same purpose as trade centers but also<br />have permanent exhibit space (30,000 to 50,000 square feet) with lower<br />ceilings than exhibition halls. These structures serve specific consumeroriented<br />industries (gifts, apparel, furniture, floor coverings, computers, etc.).<br />Because many cities do not have such facilities, these trade groups often use<br />existing exhibition and convention facilities.<br />In Europe, exhibition hall facilities are also known as congress centers."</span>(<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" class='Datatype' title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">xsd:string</a>)</li>
