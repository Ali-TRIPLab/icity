The differences are subtle but, if a<br />land-use application needs these finer gradations, create another attribute<br />table to track the various kinds of factory-built housing.<br />A manufactured home is a dwelling unit fabricated in an off-site<br />manufacturing facility for installation or assembly at the building site, bearing<br />a label certifying that it is built in compliance with the federal Manufactured<br />Housing Construction and Safety Standard Act of 1974 (42 USC 5401, et.<br />seq.), which became effective June 15,1976.<br />A mobile home is a residential dwelling that was fabricated in an off-site<br />manufacturing facility, designed to be a permanent residence, built prior to<br />enactment of the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety<br />Standards.<br />A modular home is a structure intended for residential use and is<br />manufactured off site, but assembled on site. Note that not all modular<br />homes are mobile homes.<br />Then there are other related terms not related to structure type but to the<br />overall site development character. Do not use this dimension for coding<br />such compound land-use terms. They include (with a brief definition):<br />Manufactured Home Development: A general category of development that<br />includes manufactured home subdivisions and manufactured home<br />communities (or land-lease communities).<br />Manufactured Home Subdivision: A subdivision designed and/or intended<br />for the sale of lots for siting manufactured homes.<br />Manufactured Housing Community: Any piece of real property under single<br />ownership or control for which the primary purpose is the placement of two<br />or more manufactured homes for permanent residential dwellings and for<br />the production of income. A manufactured housing community does not<br />include real property used for the display and sale of manufactured units, nor<br />does it include real property used for seasonal recreational purposes only, as<br />opposed to year-round occupancy.<br />Land-Lease Community: A residential development typified by single<br />ownership of the land within the development, with the landowner retaining<br />the rights of ownership. Home sites within the community are leased to<br />individual homeowners, who retain customary leasehold rights.<br />Manufactured Home Condominium (or cooperative): A condominium (or<br />cooperative development) of manufactured homes."</span>(<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" class='Datatype' title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">xsd:string</a>)</li>
