Many religious structures also have classrooms (for Sunday school<br />activities) and residential quarters for one or two families. But the structures<br />are primarily designed for worship and religious congregations. Some<br />modern wedding chapels and structures that accommodate a wide range of<br />religious or social activities are also included here.<br />Architecturally, church buildings have been known as either a schoolhouse,<br />modern, traditional, courthouse, utility, or storefront churches. Except for<br />the storefront variety, all these structures belong in this category. If an<br />application needs to differentiate, use the definitions below to create<br />subcategories.<br />Schoolhouse churches look like one-room schoolhouses, typically framebuilt<br />in a rectangular shape with a double row of pews to define the<br />cruciform aisle, and the pulpit centered at the head of the main aisle.<br />Modern churches refer to the explosion of innovative church forms popular<br />with designers after World War II. They take many shapes and sizes with<br />visually striking features (large entrances, long masonry spires, etc.).<br />Traditional churches refer to the standard rectangular plan with steep roof<br />pitches, masonry built, and sometimes having tall bell towers or steeples.<br />Courthouse churches reflect the 1875-1925 American municipal architecture<br />of urban centers. These centers often included the town bank, city hall, post<br />office, and other public uses along with a church building designed to look<br />like the courthouse.<br />Utility churches are buildings with low roofs, often constructed of concrete<br />blocks, sometimes with vinyl sidings, and pointed or spiked steeples, if any.<br />They primarily serve small independent denominations.<br />Not included in this category:<br />Storefront churches refer to a store or a similar structure not typically used<br />for religious activities that is now used as a meeting place for a congregation.<br />Structures adapted for congregations include barns, stores, warehouses, old<br />public buildings, and single-family houses. The structure dimension should<br />classify such structures in the appropriate structure category. Use the activity<br />dimension to specify the religious congregation activities and the function<br />dimension to identify the religious establishment.<br />Megachurches are mostly large structures that can seat several thousand<br />people and have a variety of amenities and host a wide range of activities.<br />The main structure has a stage with a pulpit with arena-style seating. It may<br />also include facilities for teaching, broadcasting, entertaining, and selling<br />gifts, books, and other paraphernalia. They may also include a chapel for<br />weddings and funerals. The architecture and interior design evoke a<br />convention or civic center design and also generate similar traffic and<br />impacts. Such structures should be classified under exhibition and<br />convention center category.<br />Any other facility that has been converted for religious events and<br />congregations (houses, office buildings, community centers, etc.)"</span>(<a href="../datatypes/string___799955032.html" class='Datatype' title="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">xsd:string</a>)</li>
