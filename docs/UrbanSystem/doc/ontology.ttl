		Given that all of the projects within iCity are situated in the urban domain, and therefore it is not surprising to find many common concepts between them. It stands to reason that some integration between the different applications should be possible. For example, if data is collected about the population, it should be usable by ILUTE and other simulations, but also by the projects developing analysis tools, such as the smart parking application. Unfortunately, there is also ambiguity in how different concepts are used, and in some cases the same concept may be defined differently in different applications. This provides a challenge not only for integration of the iCity applications, but for shareability of results: if the knowledge generated by iCity is not defined sufficiently, it will be difficult for any other researchers to understand and leverage it. 
The iCity ontology provides a common set of terms with which data can be stored and accessed. The ontology will resolve any ambiguities and disagreements between terms by defining a common set of concepts that completely captures the domain, with agreed-upon definitions. In the case that two applications attribute a different meaning to the same term, the result will be two distinct terms with distinct, precisely defined meanings. In this way we can recognize these differences and clearly identify the relationships between different concepts. The ontology will be used to organize and describe data within the iCity project. It may also be used as means of publishing or sharing data with the research community.
The resulting artifact, often referred to as the knowledge base will take the form of a triple-store(s) , created by mapping data from the iCity applications to the agreed-upon terminology defined in the iCity ontology.  Beyond this, the precise and formal nature of the ontology will support the use of services such as inference and data validation. Based on the definitions, we may be able to infer new information that was not originally part of the knowledge base. Data validation is supported as a result of the consistency-checking mechanism. We also hope that identification of relationships may serve to uncover synergies between the projects, by illustrating how data from one project may serve to inform the work of another. 


In the urban system, we recognize the following key concepts that must be defined:
Person, Organization, Household, Building, Parking, Vehicle, Transportation Networks, Transit, Land Use, Travel.
The semantics of each of these concepts will be defined by a generic ontology. These generic ontologies will then be used in the iCity ontology to define the urban system and its behaviour; its population, land use, transportation infrastructure, and the travel that occurs within it. This representation may then be extended to capture the individual iCity applications so that they may be integrated with one another and sufficiently well-defined so as to be shareable and reproducible with the research community. A Foundational Ontology will be also required in order to define the core concepts that apply across the transportation domain."""^^xsd:string ;

We may define different types of Family (e.g. Immediate, Extended). Here, we simply make the commitment that it is a group of people who are connected via the has-spouse or has-child properties. From these, we can derive grandparents, aunts, uncles, etcetera.
One question to consider is to what degree the general/extended Family concept makes sense or is useful. After a few generations the concept of a family will become quite large and confusing, with Persons belonging to many different Families. At a certain point it may be more useful to consider a relatedTo property between Persons, or only defining restricted subclasses of Family."""^^xsd:string .

Recent changes to this namespace:
$Log: wgs84_pos.rdf,v $
Revision 1.22  2009/04/20 15:00:30  timbl
Remove the time bits which have been deal with elsewhere eg in iCal.

Revision 1.21  2009/04/20 12:52:47  timbl
try again

Revision 1.20  2009/04/20 12:42:11  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.19  2009/04/20 12:36:31  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.18  2006/02/01 22:01:04  danbri
Clarified that lat and long are decimal degrees, and that alt is decimal metres about local reference ellipsoid

Revision 1.17  2004/02/06 17:38:12  danbri
Fixed a bad commit screwup

Revision 1.15  2003/04/19 11:24:08  danbri
Fixed the typo even more.

Revision 1.14  2003/04/19 11:16:56  danbri
fixed a typo

Revision 1.13  2003/02/19 22:27:27  connolly
relaxed domain constraints on lat/long/alt from Point to SpatialThing

Revision 1.12  2003/01/12 01:41:41  danbri
Trying local copy of XSLT doc.

Revision 1.11  2003/01/12 01:20:18  danbri
added a link to morten's xslt rdfs viewer.

Revision 1.10  2003/01/11 18:56:49  danbri
Removed datatype range from lat and long properties, since they would
have required each occurance of the property to mention the datatype.

Revision 1.9  2003/01/11 11:41:31  danbri
Another typo; repaired rdfs:Property to rdf:Property x4

Revision 1.8  2003/01/11 11:05:02  danbri
Added an rdfs:range for each lat/long/alt property,
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float

Revision 1.7  2003/01/10 20:25:16  danbri
Longer rdfs:comment for Point, trying to be Earth-centric and neutral about
coordinate system(s) at the same time. Feedback welcomed.

Revision 1.6  2003/01/10 20:18:30  danbri
Added CVS log comments into the RDF/XML as an rdfs:comment property of the
vocabulary. Note that this is not common practice (but seems both harmless
and potentially useful).


revision 1.5
date: 2003/01/10 20:14:31;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +16 -5
Updated schema:
Added a dc:date, added url for more info. Changed the rdfs:label of the
namespace from gp to geo. Added a class Point, set as the rdfs:domain of
each property. Added XML comment on the lat_long property suggesting that
we might not need it (based on #rdfig commentary from implementors).

revision 1.4
date: 2003/01/10 20:01:07;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -5
Fixed typo; several rdfs:about attributes are now rdf:about. Thanks to MortenF in
#rdfig for catching this error.

revision 1.3
date: 2003/01/10 11:59:03;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -3
fixed buglet in vocab, added more wgs links

revision 1.2
date: 2003/01/10 11:01:11;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
Removed alt from the as-a-flat-string property, and switched from
space separated to comma separated.
