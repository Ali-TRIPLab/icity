It may be a precondition or effect of some Activity, or more generally it may enabled or be caused by some Activity. If a state is complex, it may refer to some combination of classes of manifestations.
A note on complex states:
Say that a shopping activity, Activity-Shop, requires both the VehicleW30LGas state, but also some state wherein the mall is open, OpenMall. Each state would first be defined separately. Then, we can simply state:
precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) AND  precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)
were the preconditions required disjunctively, we could state:
precondition(VehicleW30LGas,Activity-Shop) OR precondition(OpenMall,Activity-Shop)
However, in large and complex domains, there will be cases in which the above approach is undesirable. In particular, due to the complexity of the description that results as the state being described becomes more detailed. In many cases it will be more natural and convenient to be able to refer to a single, aggregate state. We therefore extend the representation of States to capture aggregation, as approached in the concept of state trees introduced by TOVE as a construct for the activity cluster.

A State may be either non-terminal or terminal. A terminal state has no child states, and therefore refers directly to a class of manifestations, whereas a non-terminal state has child states, which may define some classes of manifestations, or further define some other complex states.
	NonTerminalState(x) v TerminalState(x) = State(x)
A state  cannot be both non-terminal and terminal.

<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#extractedFrom> rdfs:comment "This annotation property should be assigned with a URI, which points to the possible reference ontology which the annotated pattern was extracted from (i.e. the reference ontology that the ontology elements have been deeply or partially cloned by). The range is not explicit in the definition of the annotation property because it would turn the ontology to OWL Full. E.g. The participation pattern is extracted from the Dolce Ultra Lite ontology, hence the value for this annotation property is http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl" .


<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#hasComponent> rdfs:comment "This annotation property is useful for content ontology design patterns. Its value is a URI, which refers to another content ontology design pattern which is a component of the annotated one." .


<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#hasConsequences> rdfs:comment "This annotation property is used for briefly describing the benefits and/or possible trade-offs when using the CP." .


<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#relatedCPs> rdfs:comment "This annotation property can be used to indicate other CPs (if any) that specialize, generalize, inlcude, or are components of the CP. Furthermore, this field may indicate other CPs that are typically used in conjunction with the described one. Important similarities and differences with other patterns can be also described here." .


<http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl#scenarios> rdfs:comment "This annotation property is used for describing examples of instantiation of the Content OP. For example, for the part-of Content OP (which represents part-whole relations) a possible scenario is the sentence: \"the brain is part of the human body\". Scenarios are expressed as natural language sentences." .

Recent changes to this namespace:
$Log: wgs84_pos.rdf,v $
Revision 1.22  2009/04/20 15:00:30  timbl
Remove the time bits which have been deal with elsewhere eg in iCal.

Revision 1.21  2009/04/20 12:52:47  timbl
try again

Revision 1.20  2009/04/20 12:42:11  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.19  2009/04/20 12:36:31  timbl
Add Event (edited ages ago and never checked in), and location (following discussion http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-04-20#T12-36-09)

Revision 1.18  2006/02/01 22:01:04  danbri
Clarified that lat and long are decimal degrees, and that alt is decimal metres about local reference ellipsoid

Revision 1.17  2004/02/06 17:38:12  danbri
Fixed a bad commit screwup

Revision 1.15  2003/04/19 11:24:08  danbri
Fixed the typo even more.

Revision 1.14  2003/04/19 11:16:56  danbri
fixed a typo

Revision 1.13  2003/02/19 22:27:27  connolly
relaxed domain constraints on lat/long/alt from Point to SpatialThing

Revision 1.12  2003/01/12 01:41:41  danbri
Trying local copy of XSLT doc.

Revision 1.11  2003/01/12 01:20:18  danbri
added a link to morten's xslt rdfs viewer.

Revision 1.10  2003/01/11 18:56:49  danbri
Removed datatype range from lat and long properties, since they would
have required each occurance of the property to mention the datatype.

Revision 1.9  2003/01/11 11:41:31  danbri
Another typo; repaired rdfs:Property to rdf:Property x4

Revision 1.8  2003/01/11 11:05:02  danbri
Added an rdfs:range for each lat/long/alt property,
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float

Revision 1.7  2003/01/10 20:25:16  danbri
Longer rdfs:comment for Point, trying to be Earth-centric and neutral about
coordinate system(s) at the same time. Feedback welcomed.

Revision 1.6  2003/01/10 20:18:30  danbri
Added CVS log comments into the RDF/XML as an rdfs:comment property of the
vocabulary. Note that this is not common practice (but seems both harmless
and potentially useful).


revision 1.5
date: 2003/01/10 20:14:31;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +16 -5
Updated schema:
Added a dc:date, added url for more info. Changed the rdfs:label of the
namespace from gp to geo. Added a class Point, set as the rdfs:domain of
each property. Added XML comment on the lat_long property suggesting that
we might not need it (based on #rdfig commentary from implementors).

revision 1.4
date: 2003/01/10 20:01:07;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +6 -5
Fixed typo; several rdfs:about attributes are now rdf:about. Thanks to MortenF in
#rdfig for catching this error.

revision 1.3
date: 2003/01/10 11:59:03;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -3
fixed buglet in vocab, added more wgs links

revision 1.2
date: 2003/01/10 11:01:11;  author: danbri;  state: Exp;  lines: +4 -4
Removed alt from the as-a-flat-string property, and switched from
space separated to comma separated.
