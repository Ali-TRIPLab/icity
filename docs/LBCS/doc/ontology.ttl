Function refers to the economic function or type of establishment using the land.
Every land-use can be characterized by the type of establishment it serves. Land-use
terms, such as agricultural, commercial, industrial, relate to establishments. The type of
economic function served by the land-use gets classified in this dimension; it is
independent of actual activity on the land. Establishments can have a variety of
activities on their premises, yet serve a single function. For example, two parcels are
said to be in the same functional category if they serve the same establishment, even if

Ownership refers to the relationship between the use and its land rights. Since the
function of most land uses is either public or private and not both, distinguising
ownership characteristics seems obvious. However, relying solely on the functional
character may obscure such uses as private parks, public theaters, private stadiums,
private prisons, and mixed public and private ownership. Moreover, easements and
similar legal devices also limit or constrain land-use activities and functions. This
dimension allows classifying such ownership characteristics more accurately."""^^xsd:string ;

Site development character refers to the overall physical development character of the
land. It describes \"what is on the land\" in general physical terms. For most land uses, it
is simply expressed in terms of whether the site is developed or not. But not all sites
without observable development can be treated as undeveloped. Land uses, such as
parks and open spaces, which often have a complex mix of activities, functions, and
structures on them, need categories independent of other dimensions. This dimension
uses categories that describe the overall site development characteristics."""^^xsd:string ;

Although such distinction may not be useful, many park planning
applications depend on knowing the precise activity and functional

stand run by a private company, the function for that part of the park will

canyon-type landfills, cover materials may come from scraping the walls. The
final grade of such landfills is made even with the surrounding topography.
In the trench fill method, dump trucks deposit waste in trenches dug out for
this purpose. Heavy bulldozers in the trench compact and even the surface.
At day's end, the bulldozers use dirt from the excavated material to cover the
surface. Heavy front-end loaders, scrapers, and other equipment are used for
digging trenches. When this type of landfill is completed, its grade is usually

is the effect of lease or tenancy on the use that is of concern. Consider for
example a gift shop located in a leased area of a publicly owned public park.

that the use has an ownership constraint through the lease or tenancy

mobile homes, and manufactured homes. The differences are subtle but, if a
land-use application needs these finer gradations, create another attribute
table to track the various kinds of factory-built housing.
A manufactured home is a dwelling unit fabricated in an off-site
manufacturing facility for installation or assembly at the building site, bearing
a label certifying that it is built in compliance with the federal Manufactured
Housing Construction and Safety Standard Act of 1974 (42 USC 5401, et.
seq.), which became effective June 15,1976.
A mobile home is a residential dwelling that was fabricated in an off-site
manufacturing facility, designed to be a permanent residence, built prior to
enactment of the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety
Standards.
A modular home is a structure intended for residential use and is
manufactured off site, but assembled on site. Note that not all modular
homes are mobile homes.
Then there are other related terms not related to structure type but to the
overall site development character. Do not use this dimension for coding
such compound land-use terms. They include (with a brief definition):
Manufactured Home Development: A general category of development that
includes manufactured home subdivisions and manufactured home
communities (or land-lease communities).
Manufactured Home Subdivision: A subdivision designed and/or intended
for the sale of lots for siting manufactured homes.
Manufactured Housing Community: Any piece of real property under single
ownership or control for which the primary purpose is the placement of two
or more manufactured homes for permanent residential dwellings and for
the production of income. A manufactured housing community does not
include real property used for the display and sale of manufactured units, nor
does it include real property used for seasonal recreational purposes only, as
opposed to year-round occupancy.
Land-Lease Community: A residential development typified by single
ownership of the land within the development, with the landowner retaining
the rights of ownership. Home sites within the community are leased to
individual homeowners, who retain customary leasehold rights.
Manufactured Home Condominium (or cooperative): A condominium (or
cooperative development) of manufactured homes."""^^xsd:string ;

confusing. The distinctions used in this category closely follow the NAICS
definitions.
Manufacturing establishments are located in plants, factories, or mills and
employ power-driven machines and materials-handling equipment. They may
also employ workers who create new products by hand, without the
characteristic machinery-intensive enterprise. Many manufacturing
establishments process products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or
quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments. The
subcategories reflect sectors with distinct production processes related to
material inputs, production equipment, and employee skills.
Most manufacturing establishments have some form of captive services (e.g.,
research and development, and administrative operations, such as
accounting, payroll, or management). These must be functionally coded the
same as the establishment. However, when such services are provided by
separate establishments, they are classified in the appropriate function code,

pictures. The primary structural difference between a theater and a movie
theater is the projection screen. However, many movie theaters can be easily
adapted for stage performances and many stages have folding screens for
movie projections. Although screen shapes are mostly rectangular, they come
in a variety of shapes. Also, some special-purpose multimedia movie
theaters use multiple screens (one on each wall face) or the entire ceiling
surface, which are sometimes curved or geodesic in shape.
Other terms used to describe these structures include talkies, cinema
theaters, and motion pictures.
This category also includes cineplexes--complex structures with multiple
movie theaters, each theater capable of providing performances independent
of the others in the complex. Structurally, theaters in a cineplex are grouped
in a manner that allows them to share box or ticket offices, parking facilities,
lobby areas, restrooms, concession stands, signs and marquee displays, and
other service and maintenance facilities. These structures first started
appearing in shopping centers and malls, sometimes integrated with the
layout of the mall.
Historically, a cineplex meant a theater complex with two or more movie
theaters. Popular configurations have nine or twelve theaters. But as
structures evolved to accommodate twenty or more theaters, the movietheater
industry started using such terms as multiplex, megaplex, and mega
theater to differentiate these newer configurations from older cineplex
layout. But there is no clear structural distinction between a cineplex and a
megaplex. The distinction between a cineplex and a megaplex has been
further blurred because developers sometimes retrofit cineplexes with more
screens, often smaller, within the existing structure."""^^xsd:string ;

property. Besides whatever effects they have on the character of the land
use, easements also vary in their application. For example, consider a public
easement on a private property versus a private easement on a public
property. However, from a land-use perspective, the concern is primarily the
effect, if any, of such easement restrictions on the land use. For example, a
dedicated public open space is an example of a public easement that may
exist on a private or public property. In such cases, whatever public or
private ownership of the land, we characterize the land-use as having a public
easement constraint.
Some planning applications track easements and similar restrictions on
private property that may affect the existing and future land-use
characteristics. Such restrictions derive from private contracts between
adjacent property owners, owners and local governments, or owners and
federal and other government agencies. Since the land-use characteristics
depend on the owner's use of the land, this category is separate from public
ownership.
An easement is the right of use over another property. Historically,
easements are applied to specific properties and not the property owner; a
dominant-servient relationship. The burden is on the owner of land that
constitutes a servient tenement, although the easement is held by the
dominant tenement. This category refers to the servient tenement; that is,
properties that have restrictions on them due to easements held by others
(often adjacent property owners or public entities).
Easements affect how a servient land is used in a variety of ways, not all of
which affect land-use characteristics. Land-use databases do not always
maintain such ownership characteristics even though many planning
applications encounter these legal definitions. Subcategories here, therefore,
reflect commonly accepted legal terms and descriptions. Many parcel
databases from tax assessment records contain some form of easement
characteristics although they may not employ the same terminology. Use
only those categories that are applicable and revise the terms to suit locally
used phrases.
If applications need to track both the servient and dominant tenements, use
additional attributes or fields in the database to record such characteristics.
On the other hand, if the application needs precise links between the
servient and dominant tenements in an easement (for example, transfer of
development rights), employ linked or relational tables to link the records."""^^xsd:string ;

Stadiums are larger than arenas and seat 40,000 to more than 100,000

sight lines in stadiums follow a fixed sport (baseball or football), whereas
arenas are designed around the flat, central space whose size is about the size
of a basketball court. Arenas also host circuses, ice shows, indoor soccer,
hockey games, horse shows, and music concerts. Increasingly, many
stadiums, especially domed facilities, are serving arena-like events.
Special event stadiums are the kind built for a single purpose or event
(tennis, motor speedways, horse race tracks, velodromes, etc.).
Another common term for this category is coliseum. Note that the name of a
facility may have the word coliseum in it but may in fact be a multipurpose
structure (as described in the next category). Similarly, another confusing

assembly of people. Most theaters have a stage or a screen for viewing.
Some theaters may also have more than one stage for the same viewing area

audience seating is oriented toward these viewing areas. Although theaters
traditionally provided fixed seating on a gradually rising or stepped floor,
modern innovations in audio and video technology may obviate such
specialized constructions or the seating rows are flexible enough to be
reconfigured as needed. Furthermore, other specialized viewing preferences
(drive-in theaters, for example) do not have any unique structural
characteristic beyond a traditional screen for viewing in an open parking lot.

they all serve mass assembly of people for social, cultural, and entertainment
events.

commonly referred to as theaters. For example, operating theater (for
conducting operations or surgical procedures) and theater of war (for war
games and military exercises). Since such structures do not appear in

                                            rdfs:comment """Because of the unique nature of ownership constraints of tribal lands and
Indian Reservations in the U.S., this category has special significance for landuse
planning. It may also serve as a guide to developing appropriate
categories for complex ownership constraints in LBCS for countries outside
the U.S.
Ownership constraint plays a vital role in most tribal planning efforts, which
includes geographies beyond those lands that are commonly known as
Indian Reservations. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a special federal designation for
certain federal lands, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Indian ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ along with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Military
ReservationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are probably the most well known in the planning profession.
Areas (including pueblos, rancherias, communities, etc.) designated as Indian
Reservations, mainly through long-standing treaties and current established
federal government processes (such as congressional acts, executive orders,
and administrative acts), are only a subset of tribal lands. Some states also
recognize other tribes and groups that do not currently have the federal
designation. Moreover, some tribes are seeking federal recognition,
therefore, it is possible that what constitutes tribal lands will not remain
constant.
More than 550 tribes, which include 223 village groups in Alaska, are
federally recognized. About 350 tribes have land holdings in roughly 275
Indian land areas covering over 56 million acres. These lands are held in
trust by the federal government (the Secretary of the Interior serves as the
trustee) for the various tribes, and in some cases for individuals. Hence the
term Ã¢â‚¬Å“trust land,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is sometimes mistaken for reservation land though
not all reservation land is trust land. In short, reservation lands are a subset
of trust lands, which in turn are a subset of tribal lands.
A single reservation may extend across one or more state boundaries, such as
the 16 million-acre Navajo Reservation, which spreads across three states:
Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. Any power the states have over the
reservations is limited to what the federal law has granted. Each reservation
has a local governing authority, commonly referred to as the tribal
government. Land-use planning operates in much the same way as in other
local governments with some significant differences when it comes to
ownership constraints. It is these differences that form the subcategories of
this major category.
1). Tribal land in federal trust (primarily reservations)
2). Tribal fee land (private corporate ownership)
3). Individual tribal member allotted land in federal trust
Tribal land in federal trust is constrained by federal regulations much in the
same way as other lands although the process for federal approvals is not
similar. Tribal fee land is subject to the same zoning and subdivision
regulations of the local government where the land is located. Although
many reservations are entirely tribally owned, it is not uncommon for nontribal
members to own and occupy tribal lands. Allotted land refers to the
federal trust lands that have been parceled out to individual tribal members
in 160-acre units as part of a 1920s and 1930s federal policy. Land-use plans
extend over all three types of ownership constraints.
Another aspect that requires clarification when classifying ownership
constraints relates to tribal and state compacts. Depending on their purposes,
compacts may affect ownership constraints. For example, following the 1988
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which allows traditional Indian gaming as
well as bingo, pull tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, and certain card games
on tribal land, many tribes used compacts for other forms of gaming, such as
cards or slot machines. Hence the growth in number of casinos and gamingtype
developments on Indian lands. Twenty-four states and 130 tribes use
such compacts to regulate gaming and gambling uses. To classifying such
multi-tiered ownership in LBCS, assign multiple ownership codes, where
each code refers to one or more forms of tribal ownership along with the
appropriate state government category."""^^xsd:string ;

instruments, such as organs, pianos, and bands, besides large seating areas.
Some churches, mosques, temples and other similar religious structures may
also have towers (bell towers in churches, minars in mosques, or pagodas in
temples). Many religious structures also have classrooms (for Sunday school
activities) and residential quarters for one or two families. But the structures
are primarily designed for worship and religious congregations. Some
modern wedding chapels and structures that accommodate a wide range of
religious or social activities are also included here.
Architecturally, church buildings have been known as either a schoolhouse,
modern, traditional, courthouse, utility, or storefront churches. Except for
the storefront variety, all these structures belong in this category. If an
application needs to differentiate, use the definitions below to create
subcategories.
Schoolhouse churches look like one-room schoolhouses, typically framebuilt
in a rectangular shape with a double row of pews to define the
cruciform aisle, and the pulpit centered at the head of the main aisle.
Modern churches refer to the explosion of innovative church forms popular
with designers after World War II. They take many shapes and sizes with
visually striking features (large entrances, long masonry spires, etc.).
Traditional churches refer to the standard rectangular plan with steep roof
pitches, masonry built, and sometimes having tall bell towers or steeples.
Courthouse churches reflect the 1875-1925 American municipal architecture
of urban centers. These centers often included the town bank, city hall, post
office, and other public uses along with a church building designed to look
like the courthouse.
Utility churches are buildings with low roofs, often constructed of concrete
blocks, sometimes with vinyl sidings, and pointed or spiked steeples, if any.
They primarily serve small independent denominations.
Not included in this category:
Storefront churches refer to a store or a similar structure not typically used
for religious activities that is now used as a meeting place for a congregation.
Structures adapted for congregations include barns, stores, warehouses, old
public buildings, and single-family houses. The structure dimension should
classify such structures in the appropriate structure category. Use the activity
dimension to specify the religious congregation activities and the function
dimension to identify the religious establishment.
Megachurches are mostly large structures that can seat several thousand
people and have a variety of amenities and host a wide range of activities.
The main structure has a stage with a pulpit with arena-style seating. It may
also include facilities for teaching, broadcasting, entertaining, and selling
gifts, books, and other paraphernalia. They may also include a chapel for
weddings and funerals. The architecture and interior design evoke a
convention or civic center design and also generate similar traffic and
impacts. Such structures should be classified under exhibition and
convention center category.
Any other facility that has been converted for religious events and
congregations (houses, office buildings, community centers, etc.)"""^^xsd:string ;

50,000 to 700,000 square feet of contiguous flat floor space. These halls have
high ceilings (25 to 35 feet) and can accommodate a variety of events. Some
very large cities (Chicago, for example) have multilevel exhibition halls.
Convention structures have both an exhibition hall and a number of meeting
rooms. Many also have kitchen and banquet facilities, and an auditorium for
special events. Trade shows, public shows, conventions, food functions,
receptions, dances, banquets, assemblies, and other activities are typically
hosted in these structures.
Multipurpose structures have combinations of exhibition, convention, and
arena facilities. Some of these may be co-located or created out of a single
enclosed space that is reconfigured.
This category also includes the horseshoe-shaped auditorium buildings
popular in the 1930s and 1940s in many midsize to big cities. These
structures have a fixed stage at one end of a flat floor area on which were
portable seats on risers and fixed seats on other levels. Multipurpose arenas
have since replaced these kinds of structures.
Trade centers are not included here. They are usually a special-purpose office
building for a specific group of enterprises (brokers, importers, freight
forwarders, etc.). These structures belong in the office building category.
Merchandise marts also serve the same purpose as trade centers but also
have permanent exhibit space (30,000 to 50,000 square feet) with lower
ceilings than exhibition halls. These structures serve specific consumeroriented

(and sometimes managed) as a single property. Most provide on-site parking,
and their size and configuration reflect the kinds of merchandise and trade
area characteristics. The two basic structure types are malls and open-air strip
centers.
Malls are enclosed and built in various shapes and sizes. Strip centers are a
row of stores or service outlets managed as one retail entity that does not
have enclosed walkways. Most have on-site parking in front of stores. Some
may have covered canopies connecting store fronts. Typically the layout of
stores are in a straight line, \"U\", or \"L\" shaped. They can take other
configurations as well.
For planning applications, knowing the type of shopping center (whether is
serves the neighborhood or an entire region) is more useful than knowing
the basic configuration. Land-use classification systems have used a variety
of categories in the past. The basic system is divided into malls, shopping
centers, and convenience stores.
The type of merchandise (and services) offered is the primary factor
differentiating types of malls, shopping centers, and convenience stores.
Structure types vary widely within this class of commercial buildings and,
because of the competitive nature of retailing and constant search for
innovative merchandising, classifying every one of the structure types in this
category may be difficult, if not impossible. This industry is probably the
most in flux of all the categories planners encounter.
Planners typically use four basic shopping center terms: neighborhood,
community, regional, and superregional. These categories served planning
functions for over a generation. Because of the significant changes in the
industry since then, the International Council of Shopping Centers expanded
the four basic categories to eight. The subcategories in this dimension reflect
these new categories.
The terms used in this category may be confused with similar terms in
functional and activity dimensions. But the concepts are distinct: shopping
center types are structures classified by their merchandise and trade area.
In describing the subcategories of malls and shopping centers, size and area
characteristics are provided, but they are intended to be used for illustrative
purposes only in order to distinguish one type of shopping center from
another. If your land-use data set needs to track size and area of malls and
shopping centers, use the site area or building area attributes in the database
for such details."""^^xsd:string ;
